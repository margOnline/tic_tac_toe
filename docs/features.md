## User Interface

Continue to abstract the user interface aspect of the game. This will involve building out the GameDrawer class, which will be renamed accordingly. 

## Game Level

A 'game engine' class will be explored to enable games of different difficulty levels to be played. The class will be responsible for determining the next move made by the 'computer' to ensure the degree of difficulty chosen by the user is achieved.

## Game type

Classes for each type of player i.e. human and computer, will be responsible for interacting with the game user interface and determining how the next move is made.
