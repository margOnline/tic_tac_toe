# Tic Tac Toe

## Objective

To refactor an existing implementation of a tic tac toe game with emphasis on enhancement and maintenance.

## Approach

The original codebase was difficult to follow and not well organised. The first steps were to create a test suite and modularise the code to make it more readable. The second step was to enable the game to be run. I chose to run the game where both players were 'computers' because it was the simplest to implement and allowed proof of my approach.

The current codebase is now in a state where new features can be added more easily.

## How to run the game

        ruby lib/game.rb

## Next Steps
Implement the following features.
1. Enable the user to choose his own moves.
2. Allow the user to select the level of difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
3. Allow the user to choose the game type e.g. (human v. human, computer v. computer, human v. computer)
4. Allow the user to choose which player goes first.
5. Allow the user to decide which marker each player will use to mark their selections on the board.
